# DQN-Atari-Tensorflow

Reimplementing "Human-Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning" in Tensorflow

This may be the simplest implementation of DQN to play Atari Games.

The pretrained network would release soon! 

## Prerequsite

1. Tensorflow (prefer with GPU CUDA supported)
2. opencv2
3. Arcade Learning Environment ( https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment )
